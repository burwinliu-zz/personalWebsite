# personalWebsite
This is the main entry point to my website, which is found at burwinliu.github.io under my repos. 
This project involves the use of Vue as the main web t echnology, with various vue helpers (cli, vuex, svg-loader, bootstrap) and some basic js technologies (jquery and core-js)
To build it yourself, simply run the command npm run serve, or to build a dist use npm run build.

## ToDo 
* Add a preloader on initialization
* Need to create a status indicator to show where the user is, and allow navigation (like a file system)
* Create a better colour scheme to suit my tastes
* Add content to about and contact
* Create a better intro screen to have more of an impact
* responsive sidebar!

## Color schemes
Find this scheme at src/styles/pallette.scss
$shadow: #01060e;
$background: #0a192f;
$dark: #282263;
$mute-2: #5b69b9;
$mute-1: #899cda; // for all nice to have but important
$sub: #aebae2;
