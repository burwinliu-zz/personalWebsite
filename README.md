This is the main entry point to my website, which is found at burwinliu.github.io under my repos. 
This project involves the use of Vue as the main web t echnology, with various vue helpers (cli, vuex, svg-loader, bootstrap) and some basic js technologies (jquery and core-js)
To build it yourself, simply run the command npm run serve, or to build a dist use npm run build.
